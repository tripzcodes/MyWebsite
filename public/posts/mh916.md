# When Hard Work Feels Invisible: A Mental Health Check-In

It's been three months since June, and I'm trying to make sense of a pattern that's been weighing heavily on my mind and heart.

I keep making it to final interview rounds, feeling genuinely good about my conversations with teams, only to hear "we really liked you, but funding got pulled" or "we had to put this role on hold." Then, weeks later, I see they hired someone else - often for a similar role, just at a different level.

## The Part That Hurts Most

What's been hardest to process isn't the rejections themselves. It's watching people I know personally land roles where I felt like I was a strong fit, then having them reach out asking for technical help once they start.

I don't want to sound arrogant - I know everyone has different strengths. But I've spent years building what I believe are solid fundamentals. I can work through problems methodically, I understand the why behind the code, not just the how. I've put in the time to really learn this craft.

So when someone who struggles with concepts I'm comfortable with gets the opportunity I was hoping for, it creates this confusing mix of emotions. I'm genuinely happy for them - career wins are worth celebrating. But I also can't help wondering what I'm missing.

## The Confidence Paradox

Since June, I've tried being more assertive in interviews. I stopped downplaying my skills and started owning what I bring to the table. I thought maybe I was being too humble, not selling myself well enough.

But the results have been the same. Strong interviews, positive feedback, final rounds, then... nothing. Or worse, watching the role go to someone else while I'm back to job searching.

It's starting to feel less about merit and more about timing, connections, or factors completely outside my control. Maybe that's just how the industry works, but it's hard not to take personally when it keeps happening.

## The Emotional Toll

The hardest part is maintaining motivation while questioning if I'm seeing things clearly. Am I actually as qualified as I think I am? Am I missing something obvious? Or is this just the reality of a competitive market where good candidates get passed over for reasons that have nothing to do with ability?

I've always believed that consistent effort and genuine skill development would eventually pay off. But four months of near-misses and watching others succeed while I'm still searching has me wondering if I'm naive to think it works that way.

I don't want to become bitter or resentful - that's not who I am. I still want to help people when they ask, still want to celebrate others' successes. But I'd be lying if I said this pattern wasn't affecting my mental health.

## Moving Forward

I know comparison is dangerous territory. Everyone's journey is different, and success isn't always about who's "most qualified" on paper. Companies make decisions based on factors I'll never fully understand.

But right now, I'm struggling with how to stay motivated while this keeps happening. How to maintain confidence in my abilities while evidence suggests they might not be enough. How to keep grinding when the grind doesn't seem to be leading anywhere.

I suppose all I can do is keep improving, keep applying, and trust that eventually the right opportunity will align with the right timing. But some days, that faith feels harder to maintain than others.
